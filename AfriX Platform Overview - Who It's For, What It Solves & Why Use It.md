# AfriExchange (AfriX) — Platform Overview

**Who it's for • What it solves • How to use it • Why it matters**

## What Is AfriX?

**AfriExchange (AfriX)** is a **peer-to-peer digital token exchange platform** that lets people and businesses move value across Africa quickly, cheaply, and safely—using tokens (NT, CT, USDT) instead of relying only on banks and traditional remittance.

- **For users:** Buy, send, receive, swap, and sell tokens. Pay merchants (in-app coming soon). Request tokens from contacts (coming soon).
- **For agents:** Earn by facilitating token–cash exchanges (mint/burn) with escrow protection and clear rules.
- **For merchants:** Accept NT/CT from customers via QR, payment links, and APIs—with instant settlement and lower fees than cards.

We are **not a bank**. We are a **technology platform and marketplace** that connects users with independent agents and merchants. Tokens are blockchain-based digital assets with reference rates (e.g. 1 NT ≈ 1 Naira); they are not legal tender. We provide the rails; users and agents conduct the exchanges.

---

## Who Is It For?

### 1. **Everyday users (individuals)**

- People who want to **send value to family or friends** without slow, expensive bank or mobile-money routes.
- People who need **cross-border value** (e.g. Nigeria ↔ XOF) without high remittance fees.
- People who prefer **transparent fees**, instant P2P transfers, and 24/7 availability.
- People who are comfortable with **digital tokens** and want a simple app (buy → send/receive/swap/sell).

### 2. **Agents (independent facilitators)**

- Reliable people with **bank and/or mobile money** who want to **earn from facilitating** token–cash exchanges.
- People who can meet **KYC and security-deposit** requirements and want a **clear rulebook** (mint/burn, escrow, disputes).
- Operators who care about **ratings, response time, and capacity** and want to grow volume and tier (Starter → Platinum).

### 3. **Merchants (businesses)**

- Shops, freelancers, and online sellers who want to **accept NT/CT** from customers.
- Businesses looking for **lower fees than card processing**, instant settlement, and simple tools (QR, payment links, optional API).

### 4. **Families and communities**

- Groups that **send and receive value** frequently (e.g. support, shared expenses, gifts).
- Anyone who prefers **request-based flows** (“request 2,000 NT from a friend”) instead of chasing payments.

## What Problems Does AfriX Solve?

| Problem | How AfriX helps |
|--------|------------------|
| **Slow, expensive bank transfers** | Instant P2P token transfers (e.g. &lt; 1 min) and low fees (e.g. 0.5% send, 1.5% swap). |
| **High remittance costs** | Cross-border value via tokens and agents; typically cheaper than traditional remittance (e.g. 8–15%). |
| **Weekends/holidays = delays** | Platform and agents operate 24/7 where agents are online. |
| **Trust when swapping cash for “digital”** | Escrow on burns: user’s tokens lock; agent sends fiat; user confirms receipt. Disputes go to admin with evidence. |
| **Unclear or hidden fees** | Fees shown before confirm (send 0.5%, swap 1.5%, merchant 2%, etc.). No surprise deductions. |
| **Merchants paying high card fees** | Accept NT/CT at ~2% (merchant pays); instant settlement to wallet. |
| **Agents taking on risk with no structure** | Clear mint/burn flows, capacity from USDT deposit, escrow, dispute process, and performance tiers. |
| **Scattered tools (payments, swaps, requests)** | One app: buy, send, receive, swap, sell, request, and (for merchants) collect. |

## How to Use AfriX

### As a **user**

1. **Get started:** Download the app → register (email, password) → verify email → wallets (NT, CT, USDT) are created.
2. **Get tokens:**  
   - **Buy from an agent:** Choose amount and token type → pick an agent → pay via bank/mobile money → upload proof → agent confirms → tokens arrive (typically 5–15 min).  
   - **Receive from someone:** Share QR or email → they send → you get tokens.  
   - **Swap:** e.g. USDT → NT/CT or NT ↔ CT in-app (instant, ~1.5% fee).
3. **Send value:** Send → scan recipient QR or enter email → amount + optional note → confirm (0.5% fee).
4. **Request tokens (coming soon):** Request → enter their email + amount + note → they approve or reject; if they send, you receive.
5. **Sell tokens:** Sell → choose amount and agent → tokens go to escrow → agent sends you cash → you confirm receipt → done (you’re protected until you confirm).
6. **Pay merchants (in-app coming soon):** Scan merchant QR or open payment link → enter amount → pay with NT/CT. Backend/API ready; in-app flow coming soon.

Optional: Verify ID for higher limits and full merchant features; use in-app education to understand tokens and safety.

### As an **agent**

1. **Apply:** “Become an Agent” → submit business info, payment methods, KYC/docs.
2. **Get approved** → deposit minimum USDT (e.g. $5,000) to treasury → complete training/quiz.
3. **Go live:** Profile becomes active; you receive mint and burn requests.
4. **Mint (user buys):** User sends you fiat and uploads proof → you verify in your bank/mobile money → confirm → system mints tokens to user; your capacity decreases.
5. **Burn (user sells):** User locks tokens in escrow → you send fiat to user → you confirm + proof → tokens burn, your capacity increases; user must confirm receipt (or dispute within window).
6. **Earn:** From fee share, optional spread within platform limits, and volume bonuses. Withdraw earnings to your registered bank account per platform rules.

Keep response time low, accuracy high, and keep evidence for disputes.

### As a **merchant**

1. **Register:** User account → “Become a Merchant” → business details.
2. **Get paid:** Create payment links and/or show QR; customers pay with NT/CT from the app.
3. **Settlement:** Funds land in your settlement wallet; you can sell to agents for cash or reuse tokens.
4. **Optional:** Use API/webhooks for deeper integration (see Merchant Payment System docs).

## Benefits of Using AfriX

### For **users**

- **Speed:** P2P in under a minute; swaps in under a minute; agent mint typically 5–15 minutes.
- **Cost:** Lower than many banks and remittance options (e.g. 0.5% send, 1.5% swap; receive free).
- **24/7:** No “bank hours”; use whenever agents are available and for all in-app P2P and swap actions.
- **Transparency:** Amount, fee, and recipient shown before you confirm; no hidden fees.
- **Safety when selling:** Escrow holds your tokens until you confirm you received cash (or you dispute).
- **One place:** Buy, send, receive, swap, sell (request and pay merchants in-app coming soon) in one app.
- **Cross-border ready:** NT/CT and USDT support value movement across supported markets (e.g. Nigeria and XOF).
- **Control:** You hold and move tokens; optional 2FA, biometrics, and security settings.

### For **agents**

- **Earn on volume:** Fee share per transaction; optional spread within limits; volume bonuses by tier.
- **Clear rules:** Defined mint/burn flows, capacity = deposit, escrow so users are protected and you have a clear process.
- **Reputation:** Ratings, response time, and completion rate drive visibility and more requests.
- **Tiers:** From Starter to Platinum with benefits (e.g. placement, fee share).
- **Support:** Training, handbook, dispute process, and (where available) agent support channels.
- **Flexibility:** Set service hours and payment methods; manage capacity via deposit.

### For **merchants**

- **Lower fees:** e.g. ~2% vs typical card fees.
- **Instant settlement:** Tokens in your wallet as soon as the customer pays.
- **Simple tools:** Payment links and QR; optional API for integrations.
- **Same token ecosystem:** Receive NT/CT; pay out or convert via agents as needed.

### For **the ecosystem**

- **Regulatory clarity:** Platform and copy use “tokens” and “marketplace”; agents are independent contractors; no claim to be a bank or money transmitter.
- **Education:** In-app modules (e.g. what tokens are, reference rates, escrow) so users understand what they’re using.
- **Dispute resolution:** Escrow + admin review with evidence; slashing and penalties for bad behavior.
- **Auditability:** Transactions and balances backed by database and blockchain where applicable.

## What Makes AfriX Stand Out?

- **Escrow on burns:** When you sell tokens, they’re locked; the agent can’t take them until they’ve sent you cash and you confirm (or the process times out/disputes).
- **Agent accountability:** Agents post USDT security; capacity is tied to deposit; disputes can result in slashing and suspension.
- **One app, full loop:** Get tokens (buy/receive/swap) → send, request, pay merchants (in-app coming soon) → sell back to agents when you need cash.
- **Transparent pricing:** Fees and limits (including daily limits by verification tier) shown upfront.
- **User protection:** Confirm-receipt step on burns, dispute flow, and clear timelines (e.g. 30 minutes to confirm or dispute).
- **Built for Africa:** Design for Nigeria and XOF (e.g. NT, CT, local payment methods, agents, and language considerations).
- **Education and safety:** In-app education and regulatory-safe terminology so users know tokens are not legal tender and that they’re using a marketplace.

---

## Who Can Use It?

- **Individuals:** Anyone who can register (e.g. email, age policy) and comply with terms. Basic accounts can receive and send within limits; ID verification raises limits and unlocks merchant features.
- **Agents:** Applicants who pass KYC, meet deposit and training requirements, and follow agent rules.
- **Merchants:** Registered users who complete merchant onboarding; businesses that want to accept NT/CT.
- **Geographies:** Initially Nigeria and at least one XOF market; expansion as documented in product/legal materials.

Restrictions (e.g. sanctions, age, jurisdiction) follow the platform’s terms and applicable law.

## Agent Onboarding & KYC at Scale

We built agent onboarding so many applicants can join without blocking the team, while keeping quality and compliance high.

### Four-step lifecycle

1. **Quick registration (2 min)** — Agent calls `POST /agents/register` with country, currency, withdrawal (wallet) address. Status: `PENDING`. They can view dashboard and browse; they **cannot** mint/burn yet.
2. **KYC upload (5–10 min)** — Agent uploads ID document, selfie (with ID), proof of address, optional business registration via `POST /agents/kyc/upload` (multipart). Status: `UNDER_REVIEW`. Clear “next steps” in API response (complete KYC → wait for approval → deposit).
3. **Admin approval (manual)** — Admins review in the dashboard: ID quality, selfie match, address validity, risk. Actions: Approve → `is_verified = true`, KYC `approved`; Reject → with reason; or flag high-risk. Agent gets status via `GET /agents/kyc/status` and (where configured) email/push when approved/rejected.
4. **First deposit (activation)** — After KYC approved, the agent sends USDT to the platform treasury address (Polygon), then **submits the transaction hash and amount** via `POST /agents/deposit`. The backend **verifies the transaction on the blockchain** (no automatic detection of incoming transfers); once verified, capacity is credited and status set to `ACTIVE`. Agent can now mint/burn and earn.

### How we handle it at scale

- **Async pipeline:** Registration and KYC upload are self-serve; no synchronous “wait for human” in the API. Agents see estimated review time (e.g. 1–3 business days) and can check status anytime.
- **Clear statuses:** `not_submitted` → `under_review` → `approved` / `rejected`. Rejected agents can **resubmit** (`PUT /agents/kyc/resubmit`) with new docs without re-registering.
- **Admin queue and stats:** Admin dashboard exposes agent stats (total, active, pending, suspended) and KYC stats (verified, pending_review). Review is batched in the admin UI rather than one-off emails.
- **Security and compliance:** File type/size validation, rate limiting on KYC endpoints, optional encryption at rest and access logs for KYC docs; rejected docs can be auto-deleted after a retention period (e.g. 90 days) for GDPR-style compliance.
- **Mobile flow:** App guides agent through ID (camera/gallery), selfie (with face detection), address proof, and optional business doc; single “submit” then “Under review” and push when approved/rejected.

So: **scale** comes from self-serve registration + upload, clear status API, resubmit path, and admin batch review; **quality** from mandatory KYC before activation, deposit gating, and human review with reject reasons.
