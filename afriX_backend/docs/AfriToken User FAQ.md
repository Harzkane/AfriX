## Getting Started

### What is AfriToken?

AfriToken is a peer-to-peer platform that lets you exchange digital tokens (NT and CT) with other users and agents. It works like this:

- Buy tokens from agents using Naira or XOF
- Send tokens to friends instantly
- Swap between different token types
- Sell tokens back to agents for cash

**Think of it like**: A digital marketplace for exchanging value across borders.

### Is AfriToken a bank?

No! AfriToken is a technology platform that connects you with:
- Other users (for peer-to-peer exchanges)
- Independent agents (for token-cash exchanges)

We don't hold your money, process payments, or provide banking services.

### How is this different from other apps?

**Traditional apps**:
- Go through banks (slow, expensive)
- High fees
- Weekends/holidays = delays
- Country restrictions

**AfriToken**:
- Direct token exchanges (fast)
- Lower fees (0.5-2%)
- Works 24/7
- Cross-border ready

### Is AfriToken legal?

Yes! We operate as a technology platform facilitating digital token exchanges. However:
- Tokens are NOT Nigerian Naira or XOF currency
- Tokens are blockchain-based digital assets
- You're trading tokens, not money
- Agents are independent contractors

**Always check your local laws about using digital tokens.**

### Do I need to verify my identity?

**Basic account** (email only):
- Can receive tokens
- Can send up to 10,000 NT/day
- Can swap tokens
- Limited merchant features

**Verified account** (with ID):
- Higher daily limits
- Full merchant features
- Priority support
- Better rates

### How do I create an account?

1. Download AfriToken app (Google Play / App Store)
2. Enter your email and create password
3. Verify your email (check inbox/spam)
4. Done! Start using the app

No bank account needed to start!

## Tokens Explained

### What is NT (Naira Token)?

NT is a digital token with a reference rate of 1 NT ≈ 1 Naira.

**Important**: NT is NOT Nigerian Naira! It's a blockchain token that's easy to understand because it uses the same reference rate.

**Example**:
- 1,000 NT has a reference value similar to ₦1,000
- Makes it easy to know how much value you're exchanging

### What is CT (CFA Token)?

CT is a digital token with a reference rate of 1 CT ≈ 1 XOF (CFA Franc).

**Important**: CT is NOT XOF currency! It's a blockchain token using XOF as a reference.

### Why use tokens instead of actual currency?

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Instant transfers (no bank delays)
- ✅ Works across borders easily
- ✅ No weekend/holiday restrictions
- ✅ Lower fees than banks
- ✅ You control your tokens
- ✅ Transparent blockchain records

**Trade-off**:
- ❌ Not actual Naira/XOF (tokens with reference rates)
- ❌ Need agents to convert to cash
- ❌ Requires internet connection

### Can I use tokens to pay for things?

**Yes, with merchants who accept AfriToken**:
- Shop at participating stores
- Pay with NT or CT
- Instant payment confirmation
- Lower fees than card payments

**No, at regular stores**:
- Most stores don't accept tokens yet
- Need to sell tokens for cash first

### What determines token rates?

Token swap rates are based on:
- Current crypto market prices
- Supply and demand
- Platform adjustments for fairness

Rates update every 5 minutes. Always check current rate before swapping!

### Are tokens safe?

**Blockchain security**:
- Tokens stored on secure blockchain
- Every transaction recorded permanently
- Can't be counterfeited
- Protected by encryption

**Your responsibility**:
- Keep your password safe
- Verify recipient before sending
- Don't share your account
- Enable security features

---

## Acquiring Tokens

### How do I get tokens?

**Three ways**:

1. **Buy from Agent** (most common):
   - Send Naira/XOF to agent
   - Agent mints tokens to your wallet
   - Takes 5-15 minutes

2. **Receive from Friend**:
   - Friend sends tokens to you
   - Instant (< 1 minute)
   - Small platform fee

3. **Swap Other Tokens**:
   - Have USDT? Swap to NT/CT
   - Instant exchange
   - 1.5% fee

### How to buy tokens from an agent?

**Step by step**:

1. **Select "Buy Tokens"** in app
2. **Choose token type** (NT or CT)
3. **Enter amount** (e.g., 10,000 NT)
4. **Pick an agent** from the list:
   - See ratings, response times
   - Choose based on your preference
5. **Send payment** to agent's account:
   - Bank transfer or mobile money
   - Agent's details shown in app
6. **Upload proof**:
   - Screenshot of transfer
   - Transaction reference number
7. **Wait for agent** to confirm (~5-15 min)
8. **Receive tokens** instantly!

### How do I choose a good agent?

**Look for**:
- ⭐ High rating (4.5+ stars)
- ⚡ Fast response time ("usually responds in 5 min")
- ✅ "Verified" badge
- 💧 "High Liquidity" badge
- 📊 Many completed transactions

**Avoid**:
- Low ratings (<4.0 stars)
- Slow response times (>15 minutes)
- New agents with no reviews (unless you trust them)

### What if agent doesn't respond?

**Timeline**:
- 0-15 minutes: Normal, be patient
- 15-20 minutes: App sends reminder to agent
- 20-30 minutes: You can cancel and try another agent
- After 30 minutes: Auto-cancelled, agent penalized

You can always try a different agent!

### Can I buy directly with crypto (USDT)?

Yes! Two ways:

**Option 1**: Buy USDT from crypto exchange, then swap to NT/CT in AfriToken
**Option 2**: Send USDT to agent, agent mints NT/CT to you

Most users prefer Option 1 (simpler).

### Minimum and maximum amounts?

**Minimums**:
- Buying from agent: 100 NT/CT
- Peer-to-peer: 100 NT/CT
- Swapping: 100 units

**Maximums** (per day):

- CT → NT

### How to swap tokens?

2. Select "From" token (e.g., NT)
3. Select "To" token (e.g., CT)
4. Enter amount (e.g., 5,000 NT)

```
Swap: 5,000 NT to CT
Rate: 1 NT = 2.2 CT
You'll get: 11,000 CT
Fee (1.5%): 165 CT
Final amount: 10,835 CT
```

### Why do rates change?

Rates update every 5 minutes based on:
- Crypto market prices
- Supply and demand
- Cross-border exchange rates

**Tip**: Rate shown when you confirm is locked for 30 seconds!

### Can swap fail?

Rare, but yes if:

- System maintenance

**If fail**: Tokens automatically refunded, no loss!

---

## Selling Tokens

### How do I convert tokens back to cash?

**Sell to an agent**:

1. Tap "Sell Tokens"
2. Choose amount and token type
3. Select agent from list
4. Confirm sale
5. **Your tokens lock in escrow** (protected!)
6. Agent sends Naira/XOF to your account
7. Check your bank/mobile money
8. Confirm receipt in app
9. Done! Tokens burned, agent's capacity restored

**Protection**: Your tokens are in escrow. Agent can't access them until you confirm receipt!

### What is escrow protection?

**How it protects you**:
- Your tokens locked in smart contract (safe!)
- Agent CANNOT access them
- You have 30 minutes to confirm or dispute
- If agent doesn't send cash: Your tokens refunded automatically
- If you dispute: Tokens refunded, agent penalized

**You're protected throughout the process!**

### What if agent doesn't send me cash?

**Timeline**:
- 0-10 minutes: Normal processing time
- 10-20 minutes: Agent might be delayed
- 20-30 minutes: You can dispute if no payment
- After 30 minutes: Auto-dispute if you don't respond

**To dispute**:
1. Tap "I Didn't Receive It"
2. Explain what happened
3. Upload bank statement (optional)
4. Admin reviews within 24 hours
5. Decision made (almost always in user's favor if you're honest)

### Do I need to wait for agent confirmation?

When selling:
1. You initiate sale (tokens to escrow)
2. Agent sends you cash
3. **YOU confirm when you receive it**
4. Agent waits for YOUR confirmation
5. Transaction completes after you confirm

**You're in control!**

### Can I cancel after sending to escrow?

**Before agent sends cash**: Yes!
- Tap "Cancel" 
- Tokens refunded from escrow
- No penalty

**After agent sends cash**: No!
- Agent already sent you money
- Must confirm receipt or dispute
- Cancelling now = fraud

### What if I confirm but didn't receive cash?

**Don't do this!** Only confirm if you actually received cash.

If you confirm falsely:
- Transaction marked complete
- Cannot dispute after confirming
- You lose your tokens
- You might get flagged for fraud

**Always verify cash in your account before confirming!**
