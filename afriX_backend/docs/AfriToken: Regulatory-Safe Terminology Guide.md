# AfriToken: Regulatory-Safe Terminology Guide

## Purpose of This Document

This guide ensures all AfriToken communications—code, UI, marketing, support, legal documents—use consistent terminology that positions the platform as a peer-to-peer token exchange marketplace, NOT a financial service or money transmitter.

**Critical Rule**: When in doubt, emphasize that users are trading digital tokens on a marketplace, facilitated by independent agents, using blockchain technology. We provide the platform; users and agents conduct the exchanges.

## ⚠️ Edge Cases & Special Situations

### When Discussing Fiat Integration

**The Challenge**: You need to explain that agents send/receive actual NGN/XOF.

**✅ CORRECT:**
"Agents facilitate the exchange by receiving fiat currency (Naira or CFA) through their personal bank or mobile money accounts, then minting tokens to users. When users want to trade tokens for fiat, agents burn the tokens and send fiat from their personal accounts. AfriToken provides the escrow technology to secure these agent-facilitated exchanges."

**❌ INCORRECT:**
"AfriToken converts Naira to NT tokens and allows users to withdraw Naira from the platform."

### When Explaining Value Reference

**The Challenge**: NT has a 1:1 reference to NGN for user understanding.

**✅ CORRECT:**
"NT tokens are designed with a reference rate of 1 NT ≈ 1 NGN to make value easy to understand. However, NT is a digital token on the blockchain, not Nigerian Naira. The actual exchange rate when trading with agents may vary based on market conditions."

**❌ INCORRECT:**
"1 NT = 1 Naira. NT is backed by Nigerian Naira held in our reserves."

### When Describing Security

**✅ CORRECT:**
"Your tokens are protected by blockchain smart contracts. When selling tokens to an agent, your tokens are locked in escrow until you confirm receipt of fiat. Agent security deposits ensure agents fulfill their obligations."

**❌ INCORRECT:**
"Your money is insured by our platform. We guarantee all transactions and provide banking-level security."

### When Handling Support Inquiries

**User asks**: "How do I withdraw my money?"

**✅ CORRECT:**
"If you want to exchange your tokens for Naira or CFA, you can select 'Sell Tokens' in the app. This connects you with a verified agent who will send fiat to your mobile money or bank account after you transfer tokens to the smart contract escrow. Your tokens are protected throughout the process."

**❌ INCORRECT:**
"To withdraw, go to the Withdraw section, enter your bank details, and we'll process your withdrawal within 24 hours."

## 📚 Legal Boilerplate Text

### Terms of Service Excerpt

**✅ CORRECT:**
"AfriToken operates a technology platform that facilitates peer-to-peer exchanges of digital tokens (NT, CT, USDT) between users. Agents are independent contractors who provide liquidity by facilitating token-to-fiat conversions through their personal bank or mobile money accounts. AfriToken does not hold, transmit, or convert fiat currency. All token exchanges are conducted directly between users and agents using blockchain smart contracts."

### Risk Disclosure

**✅ CORRECT:**
"Digital tokens may fluctuate in value. NT and CT tokens use reference rates to local currencies for user convenience, but AfriToken does not guarantee any specific exchange rate. When exchanging tokens with agents for fiat currency, the rate is determined by market conditions and the individual agent. AfriToken is not a financial institution and does not provide banking, payment processing, or money transmission services."

### Agent Agreement

**✅ CORRECT:**
"You are an independent contractor providing token-fiat exchange services on the AfriToken marketplace. You will use your personal bank or mobile money accounts to facilitate exchanges. You are responsible for all tax implications of your activities. AfriToken provides the technology platform and smart contract escrow services but does not direct or control how you conduct your business."

## 🎯 Summary: The Golden Rule

**Always ask yourself**: "Would a regulator reading this think we're providing financial services or banking?"

**If yes, rewrite using**:

- Technology/platform language
- Peer-to-peer marketplace framing
- Agent as independent contractor
- Tokens as digital assets, not currency
- Facilitate/connect, never process/guarantee

**Remember**: Consistency is key. One slip into banking language in public communications could undermine your entire regulatory strategy.
