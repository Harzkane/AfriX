# Module 1: What Are Tokens?

## Introduction (Simple Language)

Tokens are like digital vouchers that represent value. Think of them like mobile phone credit - you buy credit, use it, but it's not actual cash.

## Key Points

1. **NT and CT are tokens** - They're digital assets on a blockchain, not Nigerian Naira or CFA Francs
2. **Reference rates** - 1 NT is designed to be roughly equal to 1 Naira for easy understanding, but it's NOT the same thing
3. **You can exchange** - Trade tokens with other users or with agents who convert them to/from fiat
4. **Protected by blockchain** - All transactions are secured by smart contracts
